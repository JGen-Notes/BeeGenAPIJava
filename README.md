Overview
========

Bee Gen API for Java is part of a more significant project Bee Gen Model Framework. The framework allows extracting design metadata from the CA Gen Local model and import to the framework. The framework has its method of storing metadata in a dedicated sort of container and preset it as a model. Bee Gen API provides a means to access such metadata, constituting what we consider a model imported from the CA Gen.

A container uses SQLite as a means of storing and retrieving information. Therefore you need to have SQLite installed in your environment. Since SQLite and Java are portable and can run on many supporting platforms, the framework and applications developed using the framework can be installed and run on all supporting platforms.
